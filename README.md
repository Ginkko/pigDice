####Creators: Jeff Lalic & Christopher Le Compte

####Description
Pig Dice Reloaded is a simple dice game where the goal is to get to 100 points. Game built using JS/Jquery.

**How to Play:**
Each round, a player can roll two dice until either a '1' is rolled or if the player ends the turn.
* If the player rolls 1, round ends and they score '0'.
* If the player rolls a number above 1, it is added to their round score.
* If the player chooses to end turn, the round score is added to their personal score.
* If the player rolls two 1's, their personal score is reset to zero.
The first player to rack up 100 points wins.
